						<p>
							Rumble Raiders is a pacman-esque multiplayer game - race against other players to collect the most loot and get the highest score, setting traps and stealing their points as you go. Avoid the enemies prowling the corridors as they try to hunt down what's rightfully theirs!
						</p>
						<p>
							Play with up to 4 players online, setting boobie traps and using your abilities against them to steal their loot and raise your own score.
						</p>
						<p>
							Get in and get out! The timer is ticking, and the pressure is on - when the clock strikes, Doctor Jekyll changes and Mr Hyde comes out to play...
						</p>
						<p>
							Loot the place while setting and using traps against the enemy players - how will you play? Sneak around with strategic bear-traps? Or lure Hyde into their path? It's your choice!
						</p>

					<h2 class="gameHeader">ABOUT</h2>
					<div style="margin:2%;">
						<p>
							This project had a small team of five artists and a single programmer, with a large focus on creating a multiplayer experience that was specifically not couch co-op. This project was created over 5 months in my final year at university and faced a lot of technical challenges along the way. Overall I'm glad with the progress we made and the final game but I wish we had some extra time to polish it.
						</p>
						<p>
							We had planned several arenas for players to pick from with different art styles and adversaries, more tools, abilities and traps, and more events and objectives through levels.
						</p>
						<p>
							My first time developing for multiplayer was a journey filled with bugs and issues. Every time I implemented a new feature it turned into a 1 step forward 2 steps back issue. Eventually I found my footing and we managed to create a complete experience.

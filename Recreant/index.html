						<p>
							Recreant is a first person stealth adventure game about a girl caught up in a dangerous world.<br><br>
							The game consists of a lot of environmental puzzles for the player to sneak around in their attempt to escape pursuit from an evil corporation.
						</p>
						<p>
							With a heavy focus on interesting AI who would patrol the map in sectors.
							Able to communicate with each other and find reference to where the player may have been, able to switch patrol routes accordingly to create an interesting and ever changing puzzle.<br><br>
							The player also has a few tricks up their sleeve. You carry around a drone with you which you can use to explore levels a bit better, tagging guards and watching patrol routes.

					<div style="margin:2%;">
						<p>
							On this project I was lead programmer and focused mainly on the AI for the project and worked with the artists to create shaders to fill out the visual style. The project took place over 3 months during my second year at university and considering the time constraint we had and the size of our team we were all very happy with how this game turned out.<br><br>
							I also wrote and recorded the music used in the trailer.<br><br>
							Being a small team of 7 people including 3 artists, 2 designers and another programmer meant we worked very closely together to get a lot of tasks complete to create a game that was voted third best game that year.

						<p>Unfortunately there is not a playable version available to the public</p>

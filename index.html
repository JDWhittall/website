				<h1>Hey There!</h1>
				<h2>Josh here and welcome to my website</h2>
				<br>
				<p>A little bit about me (but there is (or will be) much cooler things to look at around here)</p>
				<p>I'm a games programmer who studying game development at Falmouth University who, believe it or not, loves to create things (Specifically to do with writing code to make things work)</p>
				<h3>What do I create exactly?</h3>
				<p>Typically I create games or prototypes inside of engines like Unity or Unreal. But my first few years of experience programming was in web development and creating applications in Java
				<br>
				<br>
				And I quite like music production too</p>
				<h3>What's your skillset?</h3>
				<p>Through a lot of trial and error in many finished and unfinished projects I've learnt a lot that materialises in the form of programming languages, knowledge in different professional software and a lot of teamwork and management skills</p>
